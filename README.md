# Jalochex brand is the future!

Bit old project, but I have no heart to get rid of it. The code is not best quality; also there may be some problems in responsiveness. But im still proud of it as it was one of the first projects I have ever made, and it doesn't look horrific (which surprises me :D)

Box-shadows glitch when I take the whole page screenshot, they look better in reality ;d
